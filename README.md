Credit Risk Analysis Report

1. Explain the purpose of this analysis:

   The purpose of this analysis is to create and evaluate the accuracy of a data model that predicts the credit worthiness of potential borrowers

2. Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.

   Balanced Accuracy Score: 95.20% --> this means that when taking into account the sensitivity (recall and/or true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) of the model, the balanced prediction accuracy was 95.2%

   Precision Score: 92% --> This means 92% of predicted positives were correct

   Recall Score: 95% --> this means that the model was 95% precise in measuring true positive values of all positive predictions made

3. Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.

   I would absolutely recommend using this model to predict the credit worthiness of a borrower. This is because the model has an over 95% accuracy in predicting whether or not an initial loan will be repayed. That accuracy range could easily be used to ensure the lenders    remain in business/make a profit.
